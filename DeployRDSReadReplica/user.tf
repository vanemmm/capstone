# Tip - comment out multiple lines of code with ctrl + /
# Overall issue is an instance isn't able to connect to the internet
# Solvable issues: 
# One EC2 instance wasn't deployed with a public IPv4 address
# SG that's associated to the instance doesn't support HTTP/HTTPS
# VPC NACL is also misconfigured. Denies all in/ob traffic.
# 
# Subnet route table that's associated to the instance is the private subnet route table
# private route table is configured for: dest 10.3.0.0/16 target: local
# public route table is the same, but also has 0.0.0.0/0 target: internet gateway that's attached to VPC
